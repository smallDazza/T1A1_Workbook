####  1: Identify and explain common and important components and concepts of web development markup languages;
Answer: The following markup languages are used in web development:
 - HTML : HyperText Markup Language is used to create website pages. HTML defines the layout, structure and content displayed by defining different elements or tags in specific locations to render the appearence of text, images , multimedia or links to other files to display in a web browser. A element is placed by starting with a tag name (case sensitive) inside of a opening pair of "<" *name* ">", then the element content to display (not in all cases), and ended with the same tag name closed by a pair of "</" *name* ">". Some important must have element tags are ```<html></html>, <head></head>, <title></title>, <body></body>```. Others are ```<header>, <footer>, <p>, <img>, <article>, <section>, <div>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>.```

 - XML : eXtensible Markup Language is used to store and transfer data.It is different to HTML in that the document creator can define the tags and structure. XML tags are customised for the purposes of the document being sent, but are enclosed in the same opening and closing angle brackets. The XML language is a standardised format so all different types of applications can interpret the same data.

 - XHTML : eXtensible HyperText Markup Language is a combination between both HTML & XML. It combines the presentation functions of HTML but with the strict standardised rules of XML. The XHTML syntax is very strict and each page needs to include one of 3 types of DTD (Document Type Definition) declarations. These XHTML element tags are mandatory in a document: ``` <!DOCTYPE> , <html></html>, a "xmlns" attribute must be in the <html> tag, <head></head>, <title></title>, <body></body>.```The XHTML elements must also be in lowercase, properly nested and always closed.

####  2: Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:
Answers:
#### - packets
 - a packet is a unit of data that is gouped togther and sent over a network or the internet. Each packet has the information it needs to get to its destination like receivers IP address, senders IP address, how many packets the message or file is broken into and the number of each packet.
#### - IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)
 - IP addresses are used to identify the computers / devices of both sending and receiving over a network or the internet. IPv4 IP addresses use a 32bit format and broken into 4 parts, example: 172.0.68.109. IPv6 uses 128 bit format, also include letters and use colons to separate segments, example: fe80::26f0:1ffe:b96c:93b9%12.
#### - routers and routing
 - A router is a device that connects computers / devices over networks and the internet. It determines and sends the data on the best possible path by analysing the network metrics.
 - Routing is the process of selecting the best possible path for data to flow over a network or the internet. This helps reducing network failure by controlling the flow and congestion on a network.
#### - domains and DNS
 - A domain is the host name or address of a website that users type in their browser url area to visit that website.
 - DNS is short for Domain Name System which essentially translates website domain names into IP addresses. It is a global network of servers that acts like a giant directory to convert domain names into IP addresses & vice versa.
#### Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of the internet.
  - Each technology has vastly increased the development of the internet. As computers, mobile phones and all other types of devices have better technology and applications with the ability to access the internet, all will be assigned IP addresses, sending / receiving increased amount of data packets , which results in the need for better routers, so devices can access more & more domain names which results in the need for better DNS servers.

 #### 3. Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet. Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of client and server communication over the internet (50 - 150 words for each technology):
 #### - TCP
 TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol and forms the backbone of internet communications.
 #### - HTTP and HTTPS

 #### - web browsers (requests, rendering and developer tools)
